She offered to help with anybody's part since her part of model training could be done very quickly. that was nice of her. team player
> e0908222@u.nus.edu
she took the initiative to do extra things for the group when the rest are too caught up with submissions as hell week came around because she is taking lesser modules and have lesser submissions. appreciated that help. She was also helping to ask questions during the consultations with the prof and the TA.
