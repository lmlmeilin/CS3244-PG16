I was quite vocal in settling the idea and the form of the project. I originally was supposed to be more involved with the settling of the presentation but due to a family emergency i was unable to fulfill that, but my teammates were very understanding and were able to fill in for me while keeping me in the loop. Also did the base decision tree model.


3: What comments do you have regarding each of your team members? (response is confidential and will only be shown to the instructor).

Double checked alot of our code and helped make sure our order of operations for our code was correct. Also took on the neural network model which noone else wanted to do with no complaints and did a really good job with it.

Would ask for clarification on key topics during conversation that proved very helpful in realising every aspect of the project.
